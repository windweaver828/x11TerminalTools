### What is this repository for? ###

Uses sbd on linux machines only at this
time with x-terminal-emulator which
should be the terminal of your choice.
To set that terminal if it isn't set
already use
"sudo ln -s /path/to/terminal /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator"
and it should work pretty well. 

Tools I use (mostly for fun) during
ssh sessions to chat and aid in
remote assistance among other things.

Allows for a client in an ssh session
to pop open a terminal on the desktop
and immediately start chatting with
whoever is in the current x11 session
at the moment (logged in at the desktop
looking at the screen).

Alternatively you can use cloneterm to
have a fully interactive terminal in view
on the x11 (desktop) session and the terminal
session at the same time
